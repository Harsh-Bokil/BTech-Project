BTECH Final year project on "Research and Analysis on Temperature Variation with Respect to Time of Nitrogen Inside a Pressure Chamber"

This project investigates how temperature of nitrogen gas evolves over time inside a sealed pressure chamber when subjected to external environmental temperature variations. The study combines analytical modeling and simulation-based thermal analysis to help optimize thermal stability in defense-related enclosures.
